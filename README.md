# FinTech-Mod10-Challenge
Files for Fintech Bootcamp Module 10 Challenge

This is a Jupyter Notebook which demonstrates the implementation of a k-means machine learning algorithm and a principal component analysis technique.

## Technologies

Languages:
* Python 3.7

Packages:
* Pandas - For data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
* Numpy - For data analysis and calculation.
* Path - To read data from CSV files.
* Scikit - To carry out k-means and PCA model.

## Installation Guide

To repeat the analysis on your own machine, simply open the Jupyter notebok in a web browser and run each cell. This will provide data analysis as well as visualization through a variety of graphs.

## Contributors

This project was completed as part of the FinTech Bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension. Code contributions were made by myself in addition to the code provided by the program.
